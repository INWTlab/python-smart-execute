# Python Smart Execute

## Description

This is a send to REPL implementation which solves the following problems with
the current behavior of the Python extension in VSCode:

- decorators are selected automatically
- the cursor jumps to the beginning of the next non empty line
- when in debug mode, selection is sent to the Debug Console

Smart execute means that when you hit Ctrl+Enter we look at the line your
cursor is currently in and make a decision if we think you better execute the
complete block in the REPL instead of just that line.
