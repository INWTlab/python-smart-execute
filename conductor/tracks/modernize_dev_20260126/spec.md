# Track Specification: Modernize Development Environment and Setup Documentation

## Overview
The goal of this track is to modernize the project's development environment by updating outdated development dependencies and providing clear, actionable documentation for new and existing developers to set up their local environments.

## Objectives
- Ensure all development tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Mocha, etc.) are up-to-date.
- Minimize friction for new contributors by providing a comprehensive setup guide.
- Standardize the local development workflow (build, test, lint).

## Scope
- `package.json` devDependencies.
- `package-lock.json`.
- Creation of `DEVELOPMENT.md` (or similar).
- Updates to `README.md`.
- VS Code configuration (if necessary to match new tool versions).

## Success Criteria
- `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` all pass with updated dependencies.
- A clear, step-by-step setup guide exists in the repository.
- No regressions in existing functionality.
