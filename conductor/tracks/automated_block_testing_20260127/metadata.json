  "description": "I want to add some test cases for the smart execute features. We may need to do some refactoring to have decent unit tests. What I want to make sure is that code blocks are identified correctly. For that we need to have decent examples, like function definitions, classes, use of decorators, el-else blocks and other language constructs. They should be covered by the current behaviour but are only tested interactively."
